# C7082-2024 Assignment by 23358800
The assignment repository for C7082 - Techniques in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
This assigment is about training a yolov8 model on a dataset which was downloaded from Roboflow into Google Colab. The dataset is comprised of 1873 images of 6 different species of snakes and we have to detect the classes each snake falls in. In the assignment, we have discussed a brief comparison between the accuracy of a YOLOv8 object detection model trained on a dataset using 50 epochs and 100 epochs. Case 1 in the IPython notebook shows the model being trained on the dataset using 50 epochs and Case 2 shows the model trained on the same dataset but 100 epochs.
